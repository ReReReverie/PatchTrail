# PatchTrail example fixtures

This folder contains small, intentionally buggy test repositories for trying the PatchTrail workflow. Each ticket is self-contained in its own folder with the ticket transcript, buggy source, and matching regression tests. The source files are not wired into the production build.

## Fixture layout

Each fixture follows this layout:

```text
examples/<fixture>/
- <ticket>.txt
- <buggy-source>.ts
- <buggy-source>.test.ts
```

## Naming convention

Every new fixture uses a level suffix in its filename. The suffix describes the intended practice difficulty, not a judgement about the developer using it.

| Suffix | Intended level | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-student` | Student | A local guard and a straightforward regression test |
| `-junior` | Junior | HTTP status handling and an error-path decision |
| `-mid` | Mid-level | Cache-key design and state isolation |
| `-senior` | Senior | Idempotency scope and cross-account data isolation |

## Quick start

1. In PatchTrail, open the **Meeting & issue context** panel.
2. Import a fixture's `*.txt` transcript, or paste its contents into the panel.
3. Click **Extract tasks**.
4. Select a task and click **Analyze bug**.
5. Review the suggested patch and open **Regression tests**.
6. Compare the generated coverage with the matching `*.test.ts` file.

The fixtures are safe to inspect, modify, or copy into a separate test repository. The `.ts` files intentionally preserve the bug until a learner applies the suggested fix.

The expected test files use Vitest syntax as readable test specifications. They are included as reference fixtures and are not part of the PatchTrail production build.
